I conducted an extensive analysis using a diverse dataset encompassing global information. Leveraging powerful tools such as NumPy, Pandas, Gurobi, Pulp, and other optimization tools, my research aimed to derive valuable insights and solutions. The focus was on employing optimization algorithms to extract meaningful patterns, trends, or solutions from the dataset. This approach allowed me to make data-driven decisions, uncover hidden relationships, and address complex problems within the context of the world dataset. The integration of these advanced tools not only facilitated efficient data manipulation but also enabled the application of sophisticated optimization techniques to extract valuable information and enhance decision-making processes.
