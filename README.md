I have undertaken a compact research project focused on the optimal placement of "Steamboat Willie's Store" in Poland. The project delves into strategically locating the store within a city in such a way that it can be easily accessible to residents throughout the city, ensuring a maximum coverage radius of 50 km. The study specifically incorporates the application of the Cristofides algorithm to determine the minimum distance required for convenient access to all store locations. This research encompasses various facets, including evaluating travel patterns, geographic considerations, and other relevant factors to optimize the store's placement for the convenience of the city's residents.
